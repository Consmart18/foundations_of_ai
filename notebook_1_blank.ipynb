    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended as an example piece of coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students will fill in the code sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation/Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is written using Python 3.9 with requirements listed in the requirements.txt file. Requirements can be installed using\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or can be installed manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "Work will be marked as a holistic whole and students may be asked to explain parts of their code,\n",
    "but it should be possible to understand the code by reading it alone e.g. by including comments where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding can be demonstrated by producing relevant figures/metrics or by writing comments in code or markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use of the scikit-learn package is encouraged but not required. Their documentation is extremely clear.\n",
    "\n",
    " - external packages will make the implementation of algorithms in code 'simple' but you should still demonstrate that the model outputs\n",
    "make sense in the context of the course content e.g. by ensuring that parameters are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Often later questions will build on earlier parts. It may be helpful to write the supporting code in functions and/or classes so that they can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The notebook is expected to produce its outputs by 'run all cells'\n",
    "\n",
